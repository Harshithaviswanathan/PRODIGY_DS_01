# PRODIGY_DS_01

This project is designed to analyze world population data extracted from a CSV file named worldpopulationdata.csv. The script performs a variety of operations, including data manipulation, sorting, filtering, and visualization, to gain insights into global population trends. It utilizes popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Features:

Data Loading: The script loads the population data from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

Data Cleaning: Unnecessary columns are dropped to focus only on relevant data for analysis
.
Top and Bottom Country Analysis:
It identifies the top ten countries with the highest total population for a given year (e.g., 2022).
Similarly, it identifies the bottom ten countries with the lowest total population for the same year.

Male and Female Population Analysis:
The script identifies the top ten countries with the highest male and female populations separately.
It also visualizes the male and female populations in a stacked bar plot for better comparison.

Visualization:
Various types of visualizations, including bar plots and line graphs, are generated to represent population trends.
